üåê Introduction to Cyber Security ‚Äì Notes
1. What is Cyber Security?
Cyber Security refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks typically aim to access, change, or destroy sensitive information; extort money; or interrupt normal business processes.

2. Key Objectives of Cyber Security (CIA Triad)
C ‚Äì Confidentiality: Ensuring that data is accessible only to those authorized to have access.

I ‚Äì Integrity: Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of data.

A ‚Äì Availability: Ensuring that authorized users have access to information and systems when needed.

3. Types of Cyber Threats
Threat Type	Description
Malware	Malicious software like viruses, worms, spyware, ransomware.
Phishing	Fraudulent emails or messages that trick users into revealing personal info.
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)	Interception of communication between two parties.
Denial-of-Service (DoS)	Attacks that flood systems to crash or shut them down.
SQL Injection	Malicious code inserted into a database query.
Zero-day Exploit	Attack before a vulnerability is known to the vendor.

4. Cyber Security Domains
Network Security ‚Äì Protecting the integrity of networks and data.

Application Security ‚Äì Ensuring apps are secure during development and deployment.

Information Security ‚Äì Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of data.

Operational Security ‚Äì Processes for handling and protecting data assets.

End-user Education ‚Äì Training users to recognize and avoid threats.
